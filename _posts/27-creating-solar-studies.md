In this lesson learn how to create a solar study for your Revit View using the Autodesk Cloud Rendering service.

## Getting Started

Make sure you have the source files downloaded for this exercise. They are the same files from Ex 25 (Lab08 Ex01)

## What is a Solar Study

A solar study is a study of how shadows affect the built environment. In our project we will take an interior view, then in the cloud render that interior view as a solar study which ends up being a video of shadows moving along that view.

## Create a Solar Study

1. Open the Revit file from the last Lessons.
2. Open the ``Living Room Interior`` 3D view.
3. Click on the ``Render in Cloud`` button on the View tab.
4. Use the following configuration to export the view.
##### Note: selecting Still Image was not a mistake, we will convert the still image into a solar study later.

5. Click ``Start Rendering``
6. Wait for the rendering to finish.
7. Once complete click on the interior view thumbnail to expand and then click on the ``Solar Study`` button at the top of the page.

8. Set the parameters as follows:
![params](/lessons/27-creating-solar-studies/parameters.png)
9. Wait for the rendering to finish. This one might take a while. (It has to render 16 frames instead of 1)
10. Once complete if the solar study rendering does not open automatically from your "My Renderings" page you can click on the expansion arrow in the thumbnail list to select the solar study for the interior perspective.

11. Click on the play button to view the effect of shadows on the scene.

## Save your file

We will learn how to share these in lesson 29 (Lab08 Ex05)
