In this lesson we will learn how to download each of the types of rendering that we created in the past 4 lessons. We will do so both by downloading the files themselves or by using a share link.

## Getting Started

Make sure you have the source files downloaded for this exercise. They are the same files from Ex 25 (Lab08 Ex01) that we have been using for the past 4 lessons.

## Downloading Still Images

1. Open the Revit file that you have used for the past 4 lessons.
2. On the View tab click on the ``Render Gallery`` button.

3. Select the Lab08_E1_CloudRendering project, or if you named it like instructed in lesson 25 it will be called ``Spring2022_3262_firstinitial_lastname_LAB08_EX01.rvt``.

4. Click on the exterior still image that we created in lesson 25.
5. At the top of the page click on the download button, and select an image format that you prefer.

## Downloading Interactive Panoramas

1. Select the Panoramic View from the list of Thumbnails.
2. Click on the Download button as shown before. The easiest way to share and view a Pano when downloaded is with an HTML file, but if you are using some other software to view it the other formats are available. We will use .html in this example.
3. Open the HTML file with your browser of choice (Firefox, Chrome, Edge, etc.)

## Downloading Solar Studies

1. Select the solar study from the thumbnail list.
2. Click on the download button. You can either download the study as a pre-compiled video, or as a ZIP filled with each of the still images.

## Sharing your Renderings

1. Click on the Share button at the top right of the window. Then click on the ``Share to Public Gallery`` option that pops up.

2. Click on the ``New Project`` button.
3. Select all renderings created in these lessons (25-29 aka Lab08).
4. Title your gallery ``Spring2022_3262_firstinitial_lastname_LAB08_CloudRendering`` and give it an optional description (maybe write your TA a love letter).

7. This is the public link to your project! Anyone with the link can see it!

## Save your files

Once your files are ready to share copy the URL and send it to your Lab TA via Email for grading.
