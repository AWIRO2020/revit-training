In this lesson we will learn about how to create a Panoramic View with Revit Cloud rendering which means you can look all around from the point of view of the rendering.

## Getting Started

Make sure you have the source files downloaded for this exercise. They are the same files from Ex 25 (Lab08 Ex01).
We are assuming that you've read lesson 25 (Lab08 Ex01) before reading this lesson, so we will include less images and repeat instructions for the topics already covered. Please go back and read the previous lesson if something doesn't make sense.

## Creating a Panoramic View

1. Open the Revit file from the last Lesson.
2. Open the ``Exterior Perspective`` 3D view.
3. Click on the ``Render in Cloud`` button on the View tab.
4. Use the following settings to create a Panoramic View.

7. Wait some more...
8. Once complete click on the panoramic view thumbnail to expand the rendering and use Left-Click & Drag to look around inside the view, and use the mouse scroll wheel to zoom.
